## How to Use

### Adding Books (Dynamic Bookshelf)

The app connects to the `public/books/` directory. Typically, you will create a subfolder for each "collection" or "comparison set".

1.  **Create a folder**: `public/books/my-comparison/`
2.  **Add EPUBs**: Drop your `.epub` files into that folder.
3.  **Refresh**: Reload the page. Your new collection will appear in the Bookshelf list.

### Reading

- Click a collection card to open the **Parallel Reader**.
- Use the **Panel Controls** (1, 2, 3) to adjust the number of visible panels.
- Paste a URL or let the bookshelf autoload your files.
- Click **← Back** to return to the library.
